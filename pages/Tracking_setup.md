# Introduction

Four steps :
1. Installation of [Google Tag Manager]
2. Sending events from your website / webapp to GTM
3. Integration with Hyperaktiv
4. Tracking configuration in GTM

# Installation of Google Tag Manager

Read this : [Setup and install GTM](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6103696){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

It is recommended to create only one web container for both the website and the webapp.
In case of mobile apps, there should be 1 container for iOS, another one for Android.
We might also need a "server" container later, but let's see.

Follow the installation guide for both the website and the webapp.
You can test that the container is deployed properly using the "Preview" in GTM, both on the website and the webapp. The tag assistant should confirm that the container is deployed by displaying the message "Tag Assistant Connected" 
You might need to disable any adblocker in the webbrowser, cause they might block GTM script from being executed.

NB :
- In case of a website built with a CMS, the installation might be a bit different ; [follow these steps](/pages/GTM_CMS) ; use the Preview to ensure that the container is well deployed
- In case there is already some hard-coded tags implemented, we recommend to migrate the existing tags to [Google Tag Manager], and then remove the old hard-coded tracking tags.

# Sending events from the website / app to GTM

Inside your app, you will need to insert some code to send specific events to GTM. Don't worry if you're not a software developer, we're here to support you. Just ping us on [Slack community].

## Signup
After a successful signup, add this piece of Javascript :
````
dataLayer.push({
  'event': 'signup',
  'provider': 'email',
  'user_email': 'johndoe@gmail.com',
  'user_id': '123456789'
});
````

(Replace "email" by "google" or any other SSO provider, "user_email" by the email of the user and "user_id" by the internal identifier of a user inside your product)

## Login
After a successful login, add this piece of Javascript :
````
dataLayer.push({
  'event': 'login',
  'provider': 'email',
  'user_email': 'johndoe@gmail.com',
  'user_id': '123456789'
});
````

## Logout
When your user logs out, add this piece of Javascript :
````
dataLayer.push({
  'event': 'logout'
});
````

## Trial started
When your user started a trial, add this piece of Javascript :
````
dataLayer.push({
 'event': 'trial'
 });
````

## Revenue

A ``revenue`` event must be pushed everytime a payment is confirmed by the payment gateway.
Most payment gateways (such as Stripe) offer the possibility to define a callback URL when payment is confirmed ; the revenue event should be pushed when this confirmation is received.
Depending on how your app is structured, there are 2 possibilities :
1. the user is redirected to a confirmation page where the payment information is available (client side implementation)
2. the payment information is not available in a page (server side implementation)

Don't hesitate to contact us on [Slack community] if you struggle with the implementation.

### Client-side implementation
If the callback URL redirects to a confirmation page displayed to the user, the revenue event can be pushed to GTM's datalayer. The page requires the amount, currency, product and subscription type in order to set the properties, so it might happen that you will have to append those parameters to the callback URL you provide to Stripe, so they can then be extracted in the confirmation page.

Insert this piece of Javascript will send an event to Google Tag Manager :
````
dataLayer.push({
 'event': 'revenue',
 'amount': 15,
 'currency': 'EUR',
 'product': 'basic_plan',
 'type': 'yearly'
 });
````
Replace the amount, currency, product and type by the correct values :
* ``product`` : the name of the product the user purchased, for example : ``basic_plan``, ``enterprise_plan``...
* ``type`` : the type of purchase, for example : ``monthly``, ``yearly``, ``one-time``, ``life-time``...
* ``currency`` : we recommend to use a standard 3 letter-long code ; for example ``EUR``

### Server-side implementation
If the payment confirmation is not available in the frontend, then GTM's datalayer is not available. In that situation, there are several options to push the revenue event :
1. Directly to Hyperaktiv via [Amplitude] API
2. Sending a notification to the frontend from the backend (reactive apps)
3. Using a Server GTM container
4. Pushing through Segment (or any other ETL)

#### 1. Direct Amplitude API
Here is the [full documentation](https://amplitude.com/docs/apis/analytics/http-v2#request)

Here is a shorter version :
* Method : ``POST``
* Server : ``https://api.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`` (US projects) or ``https://api.eu.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`` (EU projects)
* Headers : ``Content-Type: application/json``

````
{
  "api_key": "{{api_key}}",
  "events": [
    {
      "user_id": "{{user_id}}",
      "event_type": "revenue",
      "event_properties": {
        "currency": "{{currency}}"
      },
      "price": {{amount}},
      "quantity": 1,
      "revenue": {{amount}},
      "productId": "{{productId}}",
      "revenueType": "{{type}}"
    }
  ]
}
````
Just replace the parameters in ``{{..}}`` with the right values.

#### 2. Backend to frontend notification
Especially if you're using a reactive webapp, you can push a notification from the backend to the frontend, for example to display a confirmation message. In this notification, you can add the required parameters to then, from the frontend, push the event in GTM's datalayer : 
````
dataLayer.push({
 'event': 'revenue',
 'amount': 15,
 'currency': 'EUR',
 'product': 'basic_plan',
 'type': 'yearly'
 });
````
Replace the amount, currency, product and type by the correct values :
* ``product`` : the name of the product the user purchased, for example : ``basic_plan``, ``enterprise_plan``...
* ``type`` : the type of purchase, for example : ``monthly``, ``yearly``, ``one-time``, ``life-time``...
* ``currency`` : we recommend to use a standard 3 letter-long code ; for example ``EUR``

#### 3. Server GTM container
This approach consists on creating a new "Server" container in Google Tag Manager, and from there pushing the event to Amplitude. The main downside of this approach is that the container is a VM on GCP, which requires a billing account. The VM would be in the free tier for some time, but depending on the volume of events, you could be charged.
If we stick to revenue events only, then it's a very small cost (<1â‚¬ a month if less than 100 revenue events a month).
--> we do not recommend to use the server-side tracking when it's possible to use the client-side (free).
The complete procedure to install is [here](/pages/GTM_serverside)

#### 4. Using Segment or another ETL
Just push the event to Segment / your ETL, and from there, push the event to Amplitude (this should not require to code). The exact implementation depends on your ETL.
[How to push events to Segment with the API](https://segment.com/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/server/http-api/#track)

## Custom event
On every specific action that you consider worth being tracked, add this piece of Javascript :
````
dataLayer.push({
  'event': 'my custom event'
});
````
You can also add event properties if you want.

# Integration with Hyperaktiv

1. Request an authentication key from us on [Slack community]
2. Create a project in [Amplitude] : 
   * [US based](https://app.amplitude.com/signup){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
   * [EU based](https://app.eu.amplitude.com/signup){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
3. Copy the API key, or leave the page open
4. Go to :
    1. "Data" in the top menu > "Destinations" > "Add destination"
    2. Search for "BigQuery"
    3. Check both checkboxes (it might be that the second one is not available yet, it's fine)
    4. Choose a frequency of 1h, then "Next"
    5. Dataset : put the name of your company
    6. Service Account key : upload the service account file we provided, then "Next"
    7. Data Destination Name : set "Hyperaktiv"

# Tracking configuration in GTM

As you added the previous Javascript snippets to your website / app, we can now capture those events in GTM.

## Triggers
Create 1 trigger for each event that is pushed in GTM's datalayer (select the type ``Custom event``) :
- "Event - signup"
- "Event - login"
- "Event - logout"
- "Event - purchase"
- for each custom event : "Event - my custom event"

You can also create triggers which are not based on datalayer events :
* when a button / link is clicked
* when a page is displayed

Avoid selectors based on the text of a button / link, as this text can change (translations) ; instead, use css / xpath and ids.
Ask for our support on [Slack community] if you struggle setting up triggers.

## Variables
Create 1 variable for each event property set in the events (select the type ``Data Layer variable``) :
- "datalayer - provider"
- "datalayer - user_email"
- "datalayer - user_id"
- "datalayer - amount"
- "datalayer - currency"
- "datalayer - product"
- "datalayer - type"

## Tags

1. Install the Amplitude SDK template : create a new tag > open the Community Template Gallery > find ``Amplitude Analytics Browser SDK``
2. Create a lookup table variable named ``Amplitude - API key``
   * set the API key of the Amplitude project, associated with the hostname of your website
   * leave the default value blank
   * (if you have multiple environments for your website/webapp, we recommend to create a different Amplitude project --> so you can set a different API key associated to the env domain)
3. Create the following tags with type ``Amplitude Analytics Browser SDK`` :
    1. "Amplitude - init" :
        * Tag type : ``Initialize (init)``
        * API Key : ``{{Amplitude - API key}}``
        * Triggering : ``Initialisation - All Pages``
    2. "Amplitude - 'signup'" :
        * Tag type : ``Track Event (track)``
        * Event type : ``signup``
        * Individual Event Properties :
            * Property Name : ``provider``
            * Property Value : ``{{datalayer - provider}}``
        * Triggering : ``Event - signup``
    3. "Amplitude - 'login'" :
        * Tag type : ``Track Event (track)``
        * Event type : ``login``
        * Individual Event Properties :
            * Property Name : ``provider``
            * Property Value : ``{{datalayer - provider}}``
        * Triggering : ``Event - login``
    4. "Amplitude - setUserId" :
        * Tag type : ``Set User ID (setUserId)``
        * User ID : ``{{datalayer - user_id}}``
        * Triggering : ``Event - signup`` and ``Event - login``
    5. "Amplitude - identify" :
        * Tag type : ``Set User Properties (identify)``
        * Operation :
            * Method Call : ``Set``
            * User Property : ``user_email``
            * Value : ``{{datalayer - user_email}}``
        * Triggering : ``Event - signup`` and ``vent - login``
    6. "Amplitude - reset" :
        * Tag type : ``Reset User (reset)``
        * Triggering : ``Event - logout``
    7. "Amplitude - revenue" :
        * Tag type : ``Track Revenue (revenue)``
        * Product ID : ``{{datalayer - product}}``
        * Product Price : ``{{datalayer - amount}}``
        * Product Quantity : ``1``
        * Revenue : ``{{datalayer - amount}}``
        * Revenue Type : ``{{datalayer - type}}``
        * Event Properties :
            * Property Name : ``currency``
            * Property Value : ``{{datalayer - currency}}``
        * Triggering : ``Event - purchase``
    8. "Amplitude - custom events" :
        * Tag type : ``Track Event (track)``
        * Event type : ``{{Event}}``
        * Triggering : ``Event - my custom event`` and all other custom events you created

Everything is now ready.
Just use the "Preview" mode in GTM to check that all events are properly captured by GTM.
