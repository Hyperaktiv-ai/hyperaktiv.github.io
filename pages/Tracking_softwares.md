# Introduction

Let's list a few tracking well-known tracking softwares :
* [Google Analytics]
* [Hotjar]
* [Mixpanel]
* [Amplitude]
* [Posthog]
* [Microsoft Clarity]
* [Segment]

Depending on your needs, several tracking softwares might fit

## UX/UI / product : I want to see where the visitors / users click, and where they go

If you're a UX/UI designer, frontend developer or product person., you might need heatmaps (where people click) and recording sessions.

* [Hotjar] : probably the best fit
* [Amplitude] offers this feature in the paid plan
* [Microsoft Clarity] : the tool is very limited, but if like Microsoft ..

## Global marketing KPIs and metrics : I want to have a ready-to-use dashboard

If you're a marketing person, and you don't want to spend time configuring your own dashboard :

* [Google Analytics] : for free, the easiest, the fastest ; but it's a bit more technical to get actual "conversions" (meaning payments) ; plus you will have access to quantitative metrics only, not qualitative
* [Microsoft Clarity] : for free, very limited

## Technical stuff : I want to be able to debug anything that happens

If you're a software developer, here is what you need :
* [Posthog] : just keep in mind that the access should be forbidden for non-tech people ; it's your job to plug other destinations depending on their role

## I love charts

If you're a data analyst, and you love to spend time building charts
* [Amplitude] : some bugs in the interface, and not possible to explore past events easily
* [Mixpanel] : not bad, but limited in the free version ; quite complex to build simple things
* [Segment] : although not the #1 choice

## I want to improve the efficiency of my funnel

If you're working in growth / marketing / sales, and you don't want to waste your time :

* Hyperaktiv : we built this tool for you
