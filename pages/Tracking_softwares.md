# Tracking softwares

It is very rare to use only 1 tracking software, unfortunately. The reason why you will probably need several softwares is because you don't have only 1 objective, right ?

Tracking tools are limited to the information that is collected by the tracking code on the web browser (language, location, device...), or the datapoints that you explicitely send from your website/app. Most of the time, it is not enough for you to assess whether or not a user matches your ICP.
Hyperaktiv will solve this issue by enriching the data with information found on several online datasources (LinkedIn, YouTube, Twitch, OSINT..).

Here is the biggest weakness : it's "easy" to get the data to flow into analytics softwares, but it's really hard to know what to do in order to increase signups and conversions.
Hyperaktiv is 100% focused on giving you the right recommendations. Hyperaktiv collects the data gathered by the tracking infrastructure, enriches it with external datasources, and analyses the performance of your acquisition chanels, taking into account the engagement and ICP match of your users.

## Most common tracking softwares

Let's list a few tracking well-known tracking softwares :
* [Google Analytics]
* [Hotjar]
* [Mixpanel]
* [Amplitude]
* [Posthog]
* [Microsoft Clarity]

## Which tool should I use ?

Well, it depends what you want to do !

### I want to see where the visitors / users click, and where they go

If you're a UX/UI designer, frontend developer or product person, you might need heatmaps (where people click) and sessions recordings.
* [Hotjar] : probably the best fit
* [Microsoft Clarity] : the tool is limited, but it's free
* [Amplitude] offers this feature in the paid plan

### I want global marketing KPIs and metrics in a ready-to-use dashboard

If you're a marketing person, and you don't want to spend time configuring your own dashboard :
* [Google Analytics] : for free, the easiest, the fastest ; but it's a bit more technical to get actual "conversions" (meaning payments) ; plus you will have access to quantitative metrics only, not qualitative

### I want to be able to debug anything that happens from A to Z

If you're a software developer or a tech person, here is what you need :
* [Posthog] : just keep in mind that the access should be forbidden for non-tech people ; it's your job to plug other destinations depending on their role

### I love charts, and I don't really know what I'm looking for

If you're a data analyst, and you love to spend time building charts
* [Amplitude] : some bugs in the interface, and not possible to explore past events easily
* [Mixpanel] : not bad, but limited in the free version ; quite complex to build simple things

### I want to improve the efficiency of my funnel and increase signups and conversions

If you're working in growth / marketing / sales, and you don't want to waste your time :
* [Hyperaktiv] : we built this tool for you
