# API authentication

Authentication is implemented through a Bearer token, which is unique and linked to your workspace only.

## Where can I find my API key ?

Your API key can be found in the back-office : "Settings" menu > "API".

## How to use my API key ?

Each call to our API require the following header (where ``[YOUR_API_KEY]`` has to be replaced by your API key) :

````
"Authorization": "Bearer [YOUR_API_KEY]"
````

# Create a lead

1. In the back-office, add an API endpoint as an origin in your funnel ; a reference code is generated.
2. Call [POST /leads]({{ apiUrl }}#/leads/post_leads){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} endpoint.

The reference of the origin has to be set as "ref" parameter. You can find the reference in the back-office by opening the funnel, and clicking on the API origin.
