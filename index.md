# Introduction

Hyperaktiv helps you increase conversion by segmenting your users based on :
* their engagement on your website / app
* how much they match your ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)
* their lifecycle stage

Hyperaktiv offers a back-office where you can monitor your funnel, automate actions, and get recommendations on how to improve the efficiency of your funnel.
Hyperaktiv is a data-driven platform, so we'll capture your website's visitors and app users behavior, thanks to a powerful (but simple) tracking infrastructure.

# Tracking infrastructure

We can implement the tracking infrastructure for you (just ping us on  [Slack community]), or you can implement it by yourself in a few minutes using this [step-by-step documentation](/pages/Tracking_principles).

# API

Hyperaktiv offers an API ; you can find the documentation [here](/pages/API).

# Terminology

## User

A user is a person who has been visiting your website, or used your product

## Stage

Defines the life cycle of a user :
* Visitor : when they have anonymously visited the website
* Signup : when they created an account
* Trial : when they started a trial
* Converted : when they made a purchase

## Segment

We classify users in 4 different segments, depending on their :
* Engagement score : how much a user is interested / invested in your website / app (relatively amongst the users of the same stage)
* ICP match : how much they match your Ideal Customer Profile

There are 4 segments :
* Champions : high engagement score, high ICP match
* Regulars : high engagement score, low ICP match
* Explorers : low engagement score, high ICP match
* Strangers : low engagement score, low ICP match

Hyperaktiv gives you recommendations to increase engagement of current users, and increase the acquisition of Champions

## Activation

An "Activated" user is a user who performed one of the activation feature that you defined in Hyperaktiv.

## Workflow

A workflow is a set of automated actions which are executed automatically. Workflow can be triggered when a user changes lifecycle stage, segment, or when they become "Activated"

## DataPoint

Any piece of information related to a lead.

## Enrichment

Hyperaktiv can fetch information about your users based on their email, in order to compute their ICP match, and give you better insights. Hyperaktiv uses multiple enrichment providers in order to offer high hit-rate and data reliability. Please contact us for more details.
